# WhatsApp Chat Analysis with Statistical Insights, Visualization, and Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to extract meaningful insights from WhatsApp chat data using a combination of **statistical analysis**, **visualization**, and **sentiment analysis** techniques. Implemented in Python with a **Streamlit** interface, the project offers a user-friendly tool to understand communication patterns, user engagement, and emotional tone in chat conversations.

## Objectives

- Analyze chat data to identify communication and activity patterns
- Visualize message frequency, word usage, and emoji trends
- Perform sentiment analysis to detect emotional tone of conversations
- Build an interactive web application for easy data interpretation

## Research Question

> _"How can statistical analysis, visualization, and sentiment analysis of WhatsApp chat data enhance our understanding of communication patterns and user engagement dynamics?"_

## Literature Review Highlights

- **Previous Work**: Focused on Twitter sentiment, Facebook interactions
- **Identified Gaps**:
  - Lack of integrated tools combining stats, visualizations, and sentiment
  - Limited focus on media/emoji analysis and informal text sentiment
- **Tools Used in Literature**: NLTK, TextBlob, VADER for sentiment analysis

## Methodology

1. **Preprocessing**: Clean and structure exported WhatsApp chat text files
2. **Statistical Analysis**: 
   - Message counts
   - User activity breakdown
   - Emoji/media usage
3. **Visualization**:
   - Bar graphs, line plots using Matplotlib & Seaborn
   - WordCloud for most used terms
4. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - TextBlob and VADER to score polarity and subjectivity

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python** – Core language
- **Streamlit** – Web interface for interactive use
- **Libraries**:
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `wordcloud` – Visualization
  - `nltk`, `TextBlob`, `VADER` – NLP & sentiment analysis

## Contribution

- **Comprehensive Integration**: Unites statistical, visual, and NLP techniques
- **User-Friendly**: Streamlit app provides intuitive access to insights
- **Engagement Insights**: Focus on media sharing, emoji usage, and text sentiment

## Experimental Setup

- Export chat from WhatsApp as `.txt`
- Upload it to the Streamlit interface
- Automated analysis and visualization display

## Future Enhancements

- Multilingual sentiment support
- Group vs. personal chat comparison
- More advanced NLP techniques like BERT-based sentiment models
